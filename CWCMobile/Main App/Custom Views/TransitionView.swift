/*  Purpose: This view is added as a subView to the AppsVC to hide the Apps Collection view
            on the firstLaunch where the onboarding view is presented modally.
            It is then removed from the superView after a delay of 2 seconds so that when
            the user selects the Apps collection view it is dispayed as intended.
